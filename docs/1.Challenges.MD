# Challenges of CommonUnits System
The proposed CU System has massive challenges. Obviously.

The first of them is general criticism and resistance. **Obviously**.

As a race, we've always **tried** to resist change, for good or bad—but change never stops. Unless you're American—then you're free to keep following imperial units until the last Blackhole evapourates plunging the universe into a heat death. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

The second and even more complicated challenge is practicality.

Defining a bunch of units is the easier part. Fathoming its implications is a totally different matter. Every single text book will need to change to adapt to a new system if one was to be created. Practicing mathematicians and physicists will curse us for this. There needs to be a graceful fallback or downgrade to SI. All this sounds very simple, but as I write, my heart trembles.

Take the speed of light in space for example. It will not be 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s anymore (or 299,792,458m/s if you want to be accurate).

Light travels 25902068371200 metres in 86,400 seconds or a regular day.

Make the following assumptions:

> A regular day is 10 `metric hours`.

> A `metric hour` is 100 `hectaclarkes`.

> A  `hectaclarke` is 100 `clarkes` (After [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke), influential science fiction writer and affectionately called Prophet of the Space Age).

Therefore, a day is simply 100,000 clarkes.

The speed of light in CU is now 2.59 x 10<sup>8</sup> metres per clarke instead.

Such a change will be unwelcome because millions of textbooks will say the speed of light is 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s. This is however convenient because it equals to 2.59 x 10<sup>13</sup> metres in a day. See how only the order of magnitude changes while the mantissa/significand stays the same.
