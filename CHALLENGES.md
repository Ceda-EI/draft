# Challenges of CommonUnits System
The proposed CU System has massive challenges. Obviously.
The first of them is general criticism and resistance. Obviously.

As a race, we've always **tried** to resist change, for good or bad—but change never stops. Unless you're American, then you're free to keep following imperial units until the last Blackhole dies. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The second and even more complicated challenge is practicality.
Defining a bunch of units is the easier part. Fathoming its implications is a totally different matter. Almost every single text book will need to change to adapt to a new system if one was to be created. Practicing mathematicians and physicists will curse us for this. There needs to be a graceful fallback or downgrade to SI. All this sounds very simple, but as I write, my heart trembles.
Take the speed of light in space for example. It will not be 3 x 10^8 m/s anymore.
According to SI units, there are 86,400 seconds in a day.
Assuming that the equivalent of second was something like, say microday (one 100,000th of a day), there would be 100,000 microdays in a day.
This means light will travel at ~2.59 x 10^8 metres per microday. Things like this will surely cause mass confusion and unrest if not smoothly and gradually sled in.
